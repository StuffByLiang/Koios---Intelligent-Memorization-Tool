# CPSC 210 Term Project: Koios - Intelligent Memorization Tool
  
## Summary
[Studies after studies](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/06/110615171410.htm) have shown that the **best way to enhance memorization** is by repeated retrieval, ie. testing yourself repeatedly. The best way to do that currently is through flashcards, or by doing practice questions and examples. However, writing flashcards is a tedious act in and of itself, and tracking your progress is pretty much impossible.

**Koios** is an application that allows students to study smarter, not harder. It works by allowing students to create smart flashcards for their courses, and gives a study schedule based on science by tracking test dates. It quantifies your progress, motivating you to study, and uses artificial intelligence to determine which order of flashcards will give you the fastest and most effective memorization.

## Why this project interests me
This project is of interest to me because I find quizlet's progress tracking completely useless, and their flashcard creation system is boring. Also because I need to study for my upcoming midterms.

## User Stories
